# :running_man: fitbit-google-data-analytics-capstone

In this case study, I am going to analyze data from FitBit users, which is a personal health tracking
device. The objective is to gain insights from Fitbit secondary data, to drive business decisions for
another health tracker company called BellaBeat - a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women.
